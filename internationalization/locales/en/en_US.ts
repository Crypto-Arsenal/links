      content: `Crypto-Arsenal is a startup company established by a group of outstanding master's and doctoral graduates from top domestic and international universities such as USC, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Waterloo, the University of Toronto, National Taiwan University, Tsinghua University, National Chiao Tung University, National Chengchi University, and National Cheng Kung University, among others. We are dedicated to building an open-source cryptocurrency quantitative program trading platform, creating a next-generation cloud service for intelligent trading robot development, integration, matching, and auto-following. Our platform connects with major centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX & DEX), supporting cloud-based or local strategy development environments, real-time backtesting, simulation, and live trading. It features the world's first strategy hybrid development environment, seamlessly integrating traditional indicator libraries, webhook integration for external trading signals (TradingView Alerts, Mulitcharts, MT4/5...), ML trading models, on-chain and sentiment analysis for real-time data sources. Strategy developers can freely combine and utilize these resources, making their developed strategies stand out from others. Our containerized architecture and dynamic allocation of trading robot computing power effectively reduce trading latency. TG Bot notifications provide real-time monitoring of trading performance. Through the "Strategy Arena" and "Trading Club," users/members can quickly filter out trading strategies that align with their risk tolerance and conduct backtesting and simulated trading to validate strategy performance. With a simple four-step process, they can deploy trading robots to execute strategy follow-up orders, achieving transparency, security, and autonomy in trading through the Split-As-You-Profit model and smart contracts. Token rewards and trading competition mining mechanisms share profits with customers on the platform, effectively attracting and retaining customers, creating a mutually beneficial cryptocurrency quantitative trading community. Since our establishment in 2019, with the concerted efforts of our partners, we have achieved the following together:`,
